This is a front-end remake of the google.com homepage, written in CSS and HTML from scratch.

It is my first front-end development project. To create it I have used HTML, CSS, Git, Github, VSCode and Chrome Developer Tools. 

The project is the first project in the "Odin Project" curriculum (link: https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css?ref=lnav)
