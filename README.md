This is a front-end remake of the google.com homepage, written in CSS and HTML from scratch.

It is my first front-end development project. To create it I have used HTML, CSS, Git, Github, VSCode and Chrome Developer Tools. 

The project is the first project in the "Odin Project" curriculum (link: https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css?ref=lnav)

AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT GIVEN MORE TIME:

- Add icons for the 'Account' and 'Apps' links.
- Add share link underneath the logo.
- Add magnifying glass and microphone icons to the search box.

CREATOR:

- Ross Triggol
